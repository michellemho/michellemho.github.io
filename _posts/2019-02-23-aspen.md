There's a ten-minute hike uphill from the Elk Camp lift in Aspen Snowmass that takes you to the top of the mountain. Approaching on the lift, you can see a few skiers schleping their gear up and you think *why on earth would anyone do that, I mean, this is downhill skiing and we paid for a lift ticket, right?*

Well, after a while, we got curious to see for ourselves if all that effort and fuss was worth it. Turns out, there's a 3+ mile run down the backside with hardly anyone on it. We were able to find fresh powder and wandered our way through the trees, not a soul in sight.
