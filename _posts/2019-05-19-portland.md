Finally visited Portland! Geoff spent a few months here working for Nike after grad school. He claims there's not much to see. "Great town to live in, not a great town to be a tourist." he says. Nonetheless, I was excited.

Somehow we forgot to take photos, so this picture of Geoff chowing down on a Chinese eggy pocket is all I have. We hit up a few different street food vendors here.

We also hit Powell's books. I spent a couple happy hours roaming the stacks and perusing books. We tried to get a donut at Blue Star, but by then it was 5PM and they were sold out of the day's supply. Guess I'll have to come back.
