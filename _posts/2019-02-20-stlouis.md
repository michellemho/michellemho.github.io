Michelle went to college at Washington University in St. Louis, but hasn't been back since 2013. She's excited to show Geoff the sites. Besides visiting the old stomping grounds, we're going to climb at Climb So iLL (the climbing gym Michelle worked at during her last year), run around Forest Park, visit City Museum, and see the famous St. Louis Arch.
