First stop: Philadelphia! It's only 2.5 hours away from NYC but both of us managed to take naps on the way there.

The last 48 hours were exhausting. We emptied out the Brooklyn apartment, packed everything we wanted to ship in boxes to be stored, and finally loaded up the car. With all the stress of moving, I don't think it's really hit me that we've started our road trip yet.

We also said goodbye to Sophie.

In Philly, we caught up with old friends. We spent quality time together making Vietnamese spring rolls for dinner. I have a feeling we're going to miss having fresh healthy food in the very near future.
