Back to skiing, which is our first time since leaving Utah.

A year after watching [G.N.A.R.](https://vimeo.com/18809446), I was really excited to see the cliffs and hopefully spy a naked skier or two. On our second day, we saw someone huck a backflip off a cliff during the [Red Bull Raid](https://www.sacbee.com/sports/outdoors/article229345634.html). Squallywood delivers!
