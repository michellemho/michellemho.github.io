We've spent a week in Salt Lake City already. Here are some of the highlights:

- [The Original Pancake House](http://www.originalpancakehouse.com/) is just so many pancakes. Pretty much everything comes with a side of pancakes. We took a car-nap afterwards.
- [The Tracy Aviary](https://tracyaviary.org/) is full of amazing birds. We made it intime for the birdshow at 11 AM. The cute and sociable Keas from New Zealand were our favs. Geoff passed a little metal washer through the fence to them. They played for it for a while, and then passed it back through the fence to us! Aw.

- [Momentum Climbing Gym in Sandy](https://www.momentumclimbing.com/sandy/) has amazing views of the mountains. We thought the grading was a little soft compared the NYC. We disliked the extra $5 charge for the lead-belay test.
- [Alta Ski Area](https://www.alta.com/) is just for skiers. There's a lot of short steep terrain and not a lot of trees. I think I liked Aspen better for the trees and the size.
- [Snowbird](https://www.snowbird.com/) is amazing.

- Games! We played so many good ones: Skull, Sushi Go, Codenames, Coup, Love Letter, Super Smash, Quiplash, and Overcooked 2. No ski trip is complete without a good set of games.
- [One More Noodle House](http://www.onemorenoodlehouse.com/) Thanks to Ali Wong's [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuAPnlqAZC_/), Charlie and Linda discovered this little noodle shop in SLC's Chinatown (which is really just a strip mall with a few Asian stores)

We got our fill of noodle soup after a neighborhood hike in the foothills of Draper.

Finally-- I lost my phone at Snowbird. If you want to reach me, contact me via the suggestions page or call Geoff.
