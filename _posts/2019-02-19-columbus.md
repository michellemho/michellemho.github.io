After a quick stop at Tired Hands brewery to pick up some cans, we set out across Pennsylvania for Columbus, Ohio. The 6.5 hour drive was uneventful. We ate Subway and Panera (healthy options, relatively). We listened to Ariana Grande's new album and both agreed that "Break Up With Your Girlfriend I'm Bored" was a great hit (don't read too much into it).

Neither of us had been to Ohio before. Columbus looks straight out of the Mighty Ducks or Stranger Things. Michelle's college friend's brother hosted us graciously. The guest bathroom was about the same size as our Brooklyn apartment. Michelle stayed up until 3 AM fixing bugs with the blog (now it works in Firefox!). It also snowed overnight and after some pastries and coffee at [Fox in the Snow](https://www.foxinthesnow.com/), an industrial chic bakery cafe, we bid farewell to Columbus and hit the road.
