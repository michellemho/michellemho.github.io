Oh Joshua Tree. Such a magical place. What can I say? Rocks and boulders as far as the eye can see. Spiky Joshua Trees waving their arms in the air. And the best darn people on the planet can be found here!

Geoff and I rolled into Hidden Valley campground early on Sunday morning to grab a first-come first-serve site. We found a good spot and were delighted to find van-traveling trad-climbing super-rad friends in the next site over. We were neighbors for the next week. Each day, we'd wake up, have a leisurely breakfast together, split off to climb in different areas in and around the campground, regroup for dinner, and have a big ol' campfire to end the night with music and mezcal. What more do you need?
