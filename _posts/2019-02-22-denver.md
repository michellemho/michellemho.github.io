We crawled into Denver in the middle of a snowstorm. The snow tires we put on back in New Jersey did a superb job of delivering us to our destination.

Over biscuits at [Rise and Shine](https://riseandshinedenver.com/index.html) the next morning (this roadtrip is becoming a tour of really great breakfasts across America), we learned of two interesting things. First, the existence of NUMTOTS ([New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens](https://www.facebook.com/groups/whatwouldjanejacobsdo/)). Second, the idea of "[premium mediocrity](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/)".

We stocked up at Trader Joe's (premium mediocre) and continued on our way westward on I-70 (insert appropriate NUMTOTS meme here).
