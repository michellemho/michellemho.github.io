<p>Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States. With no rivers flowing into or out of the lake, all the water comes from rain or snowfall that collects in this caldera atop Mount Mazama.</p>

<p>I spent a few days at Crater Lake with my parents before, so this was a repeat visit. But since most of the road circling the lake was closed due to snow, we were only able to see one side of the lake. The fancy mountain chateau where my parents and I stayed was also closed for the season. We only spent a few hours at the lake before heading down. Still, it’s a stunning scene.</p>

<p>We spent the evening camping at a local Sno-Park. I didn’t know what a Sno-Park was until this trip. They’re public parks for snow-mobiling, cross country skiing, and other snow activities. I’m not sure if this is standard, but this particular one had free camping and pit toilets. Why didn’t we stay at more Sno-Parks??? It also had a warming hut complete with woodfire stove, firewood, picnic tables, and candles. During the winter season, it appears there’s also electricity for lights and wifi.</p>
