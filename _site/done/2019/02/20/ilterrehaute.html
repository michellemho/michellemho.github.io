<p>Looking for a spot to eat our Kroger bag salad, we pulled over at an exit. Fast food as far as the eye could see. We continued a bit further, dejected. But from the rainy mist emerged the Honey Creek shopping mall/retirement workout walking path. We splurged on a General Tso’s chicken so we wouldn’t get kicked out of the food court for eating our own salad and peanut butter.</p>

<p>The mall is mostly national chain stores, but there was one epic flea market called Vendor Village containing aisle after aisle of people’s junk. It was eerily empty, save for two or three staff people and a few retirees either picking over the displays or dumping even more stuff. Michelle loved it.</p>
