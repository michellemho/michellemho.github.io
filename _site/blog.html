<p>After a quick stop at Tired Hands brewery to pick up some cans, we set out across Pennsylvania for Columbus, Ohio. The 6.5 hour drive was uneventful. We ate Subway and Panera (healthy options, relatively). We listened to Ariana Grande’s new album and both agreed that “Break Up With Your Girlfriend I’m Bored” was a great hit (don’t read too much into it).</p>

<p>Looking for a spot to eat our Kroger bag salad, we pulled over at an exit. Fast food as far as the eye could see. We continued a bit further, dejected. But from the rainy mist emerged the Honey Creek shopping mall/retirement workout walking path. We splurged on a General Tso’s chicken so we wouldn’t get kicked out of the food court for eating our own salad and peanut butter.</p>

  <h2><a href="/done/2019/02/20/ilterrehaute.html">Terre Haute, Indiana</a></h2>
<div class='small'>February 20 2019</div>
<p>Looking for a spot to eat our Kroger bag salad, we pulled over at an exit. Fast food as far as the eye could see. We continued a bit further, dejected. But from the rainy mist emerged the Honey Creek shopping mall/retirement workout walking path. We splurged on a General Tso’s chicken so we wouldn’t get kicked out of the food court for eating our own salad and peanut butter.</p>

<div class='small'>February 19 2019</div>
<p>After a quick stop at Tired Hands brewery to pick up some cans, we set out across Pennsylvania for Columbus, Ohio. The 6.5 hour drive was uneventful. We ate Subway and Panera (healthy options, relatively). We listened to Ariana Grande’s new album and both agreed that “Break Up With Your Girlfriend I’m Bored” was a great hit (don’t read too much into it).</p>

<p>First stop: Philadelphia! It’s only 2.5 hours away from NYC but both of us managed to take naps on the way there.</p>
