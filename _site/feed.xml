A final hurrah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This backpacking trip had a lot of firsts for me: first time using a tide chart, first time using a bear canister, and first time camping by the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/olympic/boardwalk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A three mile boardwalk takes us from Ozette Lake to Cape Alava and the coast.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/olympic/swing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;There's a fair bit of sea detritus along the hike. Lots of washed up ship parts, buoys, and ropes. We found someone made a ropeswing here.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/olympic/earlymorning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We got going relatively early in order to make our crossings before high tide.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/olympic/norwegianmemorial.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Norwegian Memorial is tucked into the woods, memorializing those who died in a shipwreck here long ago.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/olympic/campsite3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On our third night, we pitched our tent among the driftwood. We sort of stranded ourselves between two established campsites Starbuck Mine and Chilean Memorial. It was impossible to continue due to high tides and the dark. To backtrack would mean four additional miles of hiking in the dark and two overland passes. So we pitched right in the driftwood, as far back from the water against the cliff. We knew there wasn't a storm coming and the 3 AM high tide was not the monthly high. We woke up at 3 AM anyway, just to make extra sure high tide wouldn't wash us away. All clear!&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/olympic/barnacle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One thing nobody told me was how many things I was going to kill while hiking here. You can't avoid it because you have to step in tide pools and rocks at low tide crossings. We stepped on barnacles, mussels, clams, crabs, snails, anenomes, and all sorts of sea creatures. I felt like a monster! I hope their hard shells kept them safe. I tried to step on rocks mostly.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/smithrock/smith.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gorgeous.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;Gorgeous.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also one of the most convenient and climber-centric places I’ve climbed. Kudos to the local climbing associations and Oregon State Parks that help make this place awesome. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://smithrock.com/campground-bivy&quot;&gt;Bivy campground&lt;/a&gt; is super cheap at $8 per person per night. The site has hot showers, two dishwashing stations, communal picnic area that’s separate from the sleeping area, a recharging station (with USB outlets), and a little free library. All that within walking distance to the rock. Smith Rock also has two nice composting toilets strategically located at the bridge and the most popular crag area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It rained a fair bit while we were there, but Smith Rock miraculously doesn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get wet. The volcanic rock somehow absorbs or sheds all the water and you can still get good friction. Just wait out the rain, and you’ll be able to get on the rock again. This is unlike Red Rock, where it’s sandstone and you have to wait two days after rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a mix of sport climbing and trad climbing at Smith. It was a great change to go from almost exclusively crack-climbing in Joshua Tree and Yosemite to sport climbing on huge bucket-sized huecos in Smith Rock. But we did find some cracks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few days at Crater Lake with my parents before, so this was a repeat visit. But since most of the road circling the lake was closed due to snow, we were only able to see one side of the lake. The fancy mountain chateau where my parents and I stayed was also closed for the season. We only spent a few hours at the lake before heading down. Still, it’s a stunning scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the evening camping at a local Sno-Park. I didn’t know what a Sno-Park was until this trip. They’re public parks for snow-mobiling, cross country skiing, and other snow activities. I’m not sure if this is standard, but this particular one had free camping and pit toilets. Why didn’t we stay at more Sno-Parks??? It also had a warming hut complete with woodfire stove, firewood, picnic tables, and candles.

Shortly thereafter, the region was established as a national park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we visited, most of the park roads were closed and the campgrounds covered in snow. We camped in the parking lot. We drove to the Sulphur Works, a series of fumaroles (volcanic openings) that are essentially steaming hot bubbling slurries of mud that stink of rotten eggs. Charming. There was another geothermal area wonderfully called “Bumpass Hell”. We didn’t get to see it due to road closures, but we’ll have to come back!&lt;/p&gt;

And climbing history is still being made here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember sitting at my desk in the District Attorney’s office watching the live stream of Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson top out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawnwall-film.com/&quot;&gt;Dawn Wall&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. The Dawn Wall is considered the hardest free climb (meaning done without aid), going 3000+ feet up a steep blank face of El Capitan in Yosemite. Back in 2012, Kevin Jorgeson came to WashU in St. Louis to give a talk about the project, which is the first time I had heard of it. I was just starting to get into rock climbing then, and didn’t quite know even where El Cap was or what trad climbing meant. Fast forward seven years, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;waterfalls-and-valley-views&quot;&gt;Waterfalls and Valley Views&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yosemite/tunnelview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The grand reveal from Tunnel View. Driving from Wawona, you enter a tunnel which spirits you to this magical valley view. Bridalveil Fall, Half Dome, Glacier Point, and El Cap can be seen here. &quot; /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yosemite/yosemitefall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yosemite Falls is the seventh longest waterfall in the world. When we arrived in Yosemite, all the waterfalls were going at full force. Our tow truck driver told us this is the best they've been in the last 8 years (Wait, what tow truck driver, you ask? Keep reading). It was amazing to just look around and count the numerous waterfalls cascading off cliffs and casting misty rainbows over the valley.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;camp-4&quot;&gt;Camp 4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was gifted Steve Roper’s book “Camp 4: Recollections of a Yosemite Rockclimber”, which I voraciously tore through and wondered when I’d ever go. Camp 4 has been home base for many legendary climbers for decades. To have stayed at Camp 4 is a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yosemite/campfourgeoff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A typical evening at Camp 4: hundreds of tents, dozens of languages and accents, and stir-fry for dinner.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yosemite/mattresstent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;In the ultimate dirtbag move, we dragged a mattress we found by the dumpster and put it under our tent. We slept like kings for a couple nights.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yosemite Valley has a seven day camping limit from May through September. So how is it that we were able to wrangle eleven nights? Well, it turns out if you get two flat tires and have to get your car fixed at the Yosemite Valley Garage, then they give you a really nice note that explains to the campground ranger that you need to stay for a few more nights… which is exactly what happened to us. There are worse places in the world to be stranded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yosemite/flattire.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;There is no shoulder on this narrow road from El Portal to Yosemite. Apparently, this happens to a lot of people (gorgeous views + narrow road + sharp curb = flat tires). The Yosemite Valley Garage and Kathy, the hotel operator, are heroes. We were able to get back on the road within a week.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yosemite/munginella.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our first climb in Yosemite was Munginella, a 5.6 two pitch climb. I'm not sure why it's called that, there was nothing 'munge' about it. I loved it.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yosemite/selingenella.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Above Munginella is a climb called Selaginella. We came back a different day and climbed the whole thing (Caverns + Selaginella) in 9 pitches-- my longest climb yet!&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yosemite/jamcrack.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One of our Camp 4 neighbors had a book titled &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The Crack Climber's Technique Manual&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; which I pretty much read in one night. I'm completely new to crack climbing, and this trip (especially Joshua Tree and Yosemite) has featured nothing but cracks. My favorite quote from the book is: ''Face climbing is climbing what is there. Crack climbing is climbing what is NOT there.'' So true. Crack climbing is just not intuitive. This is me leading Jam Crack, which I think is the first time I actually enjoyed climbing crack. My toes didn't hurt too much, the placements were easy, and the hand jams were solid.&quot; /&gt;

We did that for about 12 straight days (save for a few “rest” days). From Bishop, it’s about a 40 minute drive up to Mammoth to ski and a 20 minute drive to Owens River Gorge to climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We camped at the Pleasant Valley Pit Campground (only $5 per site per night) for 10 days and spent two nights at &lt;a href=&quot;www.thehostelcalifornia.com&quot;&gt;The Hostel California&lt;/a&gt; (mostly to shower and watch Game of Thrones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one of our rest days, we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawsmuseum.org/&quot;&gt;Laws Museum&lt;/a&gt;. The place reminded me of the aircraft hangar at Floyd Bennett field, Boomtown 1915 from the Las Vegas Springs Preserve, and even Governors Island, with all its old army barracks and houses. Except the Laws Museum is all about trains, mining, and pioneer living. We spent a sunny morning poking around the grounds and marveling at the vast collection of old junk and thinking about how tough life was back then and how we can now drive away in air conditioned wagons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bishop/southlake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On another rest day, we went to South Lake, west of Bishop up in the Sierras. We couldn't hike any trails because of the snow, but it was still very neat to see this snow covered landscape.&quot; /&gt;

Discovering the 200 inch snow base and the fact that Mammoth stays open until July 4th (whaaat?!) we pretty much immediately bought Ikon passes for 2019/2020 so we can start using them now. We’re now looking for short-term rentals in Bishop/Mammoth Lakes area, anyone have any connections?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://holidayhausmotelandhostel.com/&quot;&gt;Moderne Hostel&lt;/a&gt; where we watched Game of Thrones, cooked our dinners, and met great people. In the morning, we walked over to the Village Gondola, and rode over the town marveling at the height of the snow– there were two story houses still almost buried!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mammoth/mammoth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our first  day at Mammoth were cold, windy, and not very good conditions. It was completely white-out from the top of the bottom lifts, and all the other higher lifts were closed. Yet by the base, it was super slushy and hard to ski over. Still found some fresh snow and got a few good turns in. On our second day, the skies cleared in the afternoon and we were able to take a lift higher up. We did countless laps on the Facelift lift.&quot; /&gt;

They are limestone precipitations that form underwater, meaning their appearance at the surface indicate how much the water level has dropped. Apparently Los Angeles  drained the lake for water several decades ago. There are now efforts to restore the lake to its previous level.

Apparently, LA diverting water is a theme in this whole region. Our fellow hostel guests told us about an old movie &amp;lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)'&amp;gt;'Chinatown'&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a dramatized story about the water war betwen Los Angeles and Owens Valley near Bishop.&quot; /&gt;

Discovering the 200 inch snow base and the fact that Mammoth stays open until July 4th (whaaat?!) we pretty much immediately bought Ikon passes for 2019/2020 so we can start using them now. We’re now looking for short-term rentals in Bishop/Mammoth Lakes area, anyone have any connections?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Truckee/Tahoe/Squaw</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/done/2019/04/11/tahoe.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Truckee/Tahoe/Squaw" /><published>2019-04-11T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/done/2019/04/11/tahoe</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/done/2019/04/11/tahoe.html">&lt;p&gt;Back to skiing, which is our first time since leaving Utah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year after watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/18809446&quot;&gt;G.N.A.R.&lt;/a&gt;, I was really excited to see the cliffs and hopefully spy a naked skier or two. On our second day, we saw someone huck a backflip off a cliff during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sacbee.com/sports/outdoors/article229345634.html&quot;&gt;Red Bull Raid&lt;/a&gt;. Squallywood delivers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tahoe/tireswing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;After leaving Truckee, we drove around Lake Tahoe and found this little tireswing on the Nevada side! Also-- gas is WAY cheaper once you cross the border to Nevada. Reno is now a semi-serious contender for where we move.&quot; /&gt;
