<h1>Itinerary</h1>

<ul>
    
    <h2>Brooklyn, NY</h2>
<div class='small'>February 6 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/nyc.jpg" alt="NYC Skyline at night" /></p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Philadelphia, PA</h2>
<div class='small'>February 18 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>First stop: Philadelphia! It’s only 2.5 hours away from NYC but both of us managed to take naps on the way there.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Columbus, OH</h2>
<div class='small'>February 19 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>After a quick stop at Tired Hands brewery to pick up some cans, we set out across Pennsylvania for Columbus, Ohio. The 6.5 hour drive was uneventful. We ate Subway and Panera (healthy options, relatively). We listened to Ariana Grande’s new album and both agreed that “Break Up With Your Girlfriend I’m Bored” was a great hit (don’t read too much into it).</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Terre Haute, Indiana</h2>
<div class='small'>February 20 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>Looking for a spot to eat our Kroger bag salad, we pulled over at an exit. Fast food as far as the eye could see. We continued a bit further, dejected. But from the rainy mist emerged the Honey Creek shopping mall/retirement workout walking path. We splurged on a General Tso’s chicken so we wouldn’t get kicked out of the food court for eating our own salad and peanut butter.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>St. Louis, MO</h2>
<div class='small'>February 20 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>In St. Louis, we ran around Washington University (my alma mater), Forest Park, the History Museum, the Art Museum, City Museum and ate toasted ravioli and Imo’s pizza. It was my first time back in St. Louis since graduating.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Kansas City, MO</h2>
<div class='small'>February 21 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We couch-surfed in KC! Despite having made the long St. Louis &lt;–&gt; Denver drive multiple times during college, I have only ever just stopped for Arthur Bryant’s barbecue here. We stayed in Overland Park, drank whiskey, played board games, and had crepes with our couchsurfing host, Andrew.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Denver, CO</h2>
<div class='small'>February 22 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We crawled into Denver in the middle of a snowstorm. The snow tires we put on back in New Jersey did a superb job of delivering us to our destination.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Aspen, CO</h2>
<div class='small'>February 23 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>There’s a ten-minute hike uphill from the Elk Camp lift in Aspen Snowmass that takes you to the top of the mountain. Approaching on the lift, you can see a few skiers schleping their gear up and you think <em>why on earth would anyone do that, I mean, this is downhill skiing and we paid for a lift ticket, right?</em></p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Salt Lake City, UT</h2>
<div class='small'>March 5 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We’ve spent a week in Salt Lake City already. Here are some of the highlights:</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Moab, Utah</h2>
<div class='small'>March 8 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>My brother Andrew and his girlfriend Kim came to visit us in SLC and we all drove down to Moab to see the national parks in the area for a couple days.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Capitol Reef, Utah</h2>
<div class='small'>March 12 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>Capitol Reef was named after its  capitol building-like dome rock formations and  impassable ridges, which are reminiscient of how reefs are barriers for ships.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Las Vegas, NV</h2>
<div class='small'>March 17 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We spent twelve days in Las Vegas.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Los Angeles, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>March 28 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>In LA, we met up with Kim, Andrew and Mochi again! We also got barbecue with my cousin Jaymond and his friend Christina at <a href="https://www.theparksfinest.com/">The Park’s Finest</a>.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Joshua Tree, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>March 31 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>Oh Joshua Tree. Such a magical place. What can I say? Rocks and boulders as far as the eye can see. Spiky Joshua Trees waving their arms in the air. And the best darn people on the planet can be found here!</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Big Sur, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>April 7 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We spent two days in Big Sur.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Oakland, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>April 9 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We spent a restful three days in Oakland, catching up with my extended family. It was great to see everyone again and introduce Geoff.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Squaw Valley, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>April 11 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>Back to skiing, which is our first time since leaving Utah.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Mammoth Lakes, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>April 14 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We drove down to Mammoth Lakes to ski more. Discovering the 200 inch snow base and the fact that Mammoth stays open until July 4th (whaaat?!) we pretty much immediately bought Ikon passes for 2019/2020 so we can start using them now. We’re now looking for short-term rentals in Bishop/Mammoth Lakes area, anyone have any connections?</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Bishop, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>April 16 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>In Bishop, we hit a sweet spot alternating days climbing and skiing. We did that for about 12 straight days (save for a few “rest” days). From Bishop, it’s about a 40 minute drive up to Mammoth to ski and a 20 minute drive to Owens River Gorge to climb.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Yosemite National Park, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>April 25 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We made it to the mecca of climbing: Yosemite. There is just so much climbing history here. It’s so exciting to think that we’re climbing the same rock and routes that legends established decades ago. And climbing history is still being made here!</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Modesto, CA</h2>
<div class='small'>May 11 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>Just some much needed Airbnb, shower, computer, and Game of Thrones catch-up time.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Lassen Volcanic National Park</h2>
<div class='small'>May 12 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>Everyone thought Lassen Peak was an extinct volcano until it suddenly exploded on Memorial Day in 1914. Shortly thereafter, the region was established as a national park.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Crater Lake National Park</h2>
<div class='small'>May 13 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States. With no rivers flowing into or out of the lake, all the water comes from rain or snowfall that collects in this caldera atop Mount Mazama.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Smith Rock, OR</h2>
<div class='small'>May 14 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>And back to climbing! Smith Rock is spectular. Bright red-orange rocks, green grassy meadows, blue skies, a burbling creek… What more could you ask for?</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Portland, OR</h2>
<div class='small'>May 19 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>Finally visited Portland! Geoff spent a few months here working for Nike after grad school. He claims there’s not much to see. “Great town to live in, not a great town to be a tourist.” he says. Nonetheless, I was excited.</p>

</p> -->

    
    <h2>Olympic National Park</h2>
<div class='small'>May 20 2019</div>
<!-- <p><p>We decided to end our 3 month long road-trip with a multiday coastal backpacking trip in Olympic National Park. A final hurrah.</p>

</p> -->

      
    <p>...</p>
    <h2>Seattle, Washington</h2>
    <div class='small'>Arrived May 25th 2019!</div>
